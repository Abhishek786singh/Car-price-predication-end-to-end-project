# Car-Price-Prediction
Project description-
In this project, we are taking the data set from Kaggle and apply some machine learning techniques 
for predicting the price of the car and after that we make a web APP with the help of flask and deploy on Heroku.

So, basically the main idea of this project is that we have some features of the car and how old it is from this data

 we have to predict the price of car in this present day.
